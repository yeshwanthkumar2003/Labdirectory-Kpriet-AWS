# Labdirectory-Kpriet-AWS
Labdirectory Kpriet
My project aims to create a cloud-based lab directory leveraging AWS services' power to provide a robust, secure, and highly available solution. 
I have used EC2 instances for application hosting, S3 for storage, DynamoDB for database management, and VPC for network isolation. I have also implemented an Internet Gateway and Load Balancer to ensure optimal traffic flow and automatic scaling to handle any increase in demand. 

The project also takes into account security and compliance by implementing security best practices in IAM and adhering to industry standards. 
The solution is highly scalable by utilizing AWS services and can easily handle a large amount of data and traffic. 
This project showcases my cloud computing expertise and ability to design and implement a solution that meets the business practices' needs.
